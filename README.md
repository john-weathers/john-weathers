### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started developing software in June 2022. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer/engineer (web development has been my area of focus). For the projects I have done to this point, I have primarily used the MERN stack, however, I am continually working on building my skills. Some of my current learning pipeline includes TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and diving deeper into React frameworks, likely using Remix for my next project.
