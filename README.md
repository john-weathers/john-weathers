### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated computer science student looking for a software engineering internship. As a career changer, I believe I can bring a more diverse perspective than the average undergraduate student. Furthermore, I already have a track record of making positive contributions to organizations. I discovered my passion for programming in 2022 and have now been programming for one and a half years. I hope to be a value add as a SWE intern while I continue to build my skill set as a developer. Please see my websites to view examples of my work:
